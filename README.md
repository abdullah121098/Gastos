Post Graduate MCA Project

Admin Dashboard Website-based.

Step 1: Project Initiation
      Identify the need for an Admin Dashboard for recording daily expenses and credits.
      Define the scope and objectives of the project.
      Assemble a project team, including developers, designers, and database experts.
      Determine the technologies to be used: PHP for server-side scripting, HTML for markup, Bootstrap for front-end development, 
    JavaScript for client-side scripting, and MySQL for the database.
    
Step 2: Requirement Gathering
    Interact with stakeholders to understand the specific features and functionalities required for the Admin Dashboard.
    Document the requirements, including user roles, data to be captured (daily expenses and credits), and any specific features requested.

Step 3: Design
    Create wireframes and mockups for the Admin Dashboard interface.
    Define the database schema to store daily expenses and credit data.
    Plan the system architecture and workflow for expense and credit recording.
    Ensure the design is user-friendly and responsive, utilizing Bootstrap for a consistent and mobile-friendly layout.

Step 4: Coding
    Implement the server-side logic using PHP for handling data processing and business logic.
    Develop the front end using HTML for markup, Bootstrap for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic and interactive elements.
    Integrate the MySQL database to store and retrieve daily expenses and credit data.
    Code the user authentication and authorization mechanisms for secure access.

Step 5: Testing
    Conduct unit testing to ensure individual components work as expected.
    Perform integration testing to check the interaction between different modules.
    Test the system's responsiveness and compatibility across various browsers and devices.
    Identify and fix bugs or issues through debugging.

Step 6: Deployment
    Prepare for deployment by configuring the server environment.
    Migrate the codebase and database to the production server.
    Conduct final checks to ensure everything is set up correctly.
    Roll out the Admin Dashboard for use by the intended audience.

Step 7: Debugging and Optimization
    Monitor the system for any post-deployment issues.
    Address any bugs or errors that may arise in the live environment.
    Optimize code and database queries for better performance if needed.

Step 8: Documentation
      Create comprehensive documentation, including user manuals and technical documentation for future reference.
      Document the system architecture, codebase structure, and database schema.
